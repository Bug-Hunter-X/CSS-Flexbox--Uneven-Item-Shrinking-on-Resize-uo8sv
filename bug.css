The following CSS code snippet intends to create a responsive layout using flexbox, but it fails to distribute space evenly among items within a container when the screen size is reduced. This happens due to an incorrect use of the `flex-shrink` property.  The items are shrinking unevenly because their content size (width) varies.  This is an uncommon error because developers often focus on `flex-grow` for expansion and overlook the implications of `flex-shrink`. 

```css
.container {
display: flex;
}

.item {
width: 200px;
}
```
