To correct the uneven shrinking, set `flex-shrink: 0;` on the `.item` class. This prevents the items from shrinking, allowing the flex container to distribute the available space more evenly.

```css
.container {
display: flex;
}

.item {
width: 200px;
flex-shrink: 0;
}
```

This ensures all items maintain their minimum width, leading to a more balanced and responsive layout.
